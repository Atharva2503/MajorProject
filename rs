	Spatial gray-level dependence matrices (SGDM) method has
	been used for extracting statistical texture features by Sanjay B. 		Dhaygude et al. [5]. RGB images have been
	converted into Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color space representation and 		showed the H, S and V components.

	
	Methodology
	1) RGB image acquisition;
	2) convert the input image into color space;
	3) Segment the components;
	4) obtain the useful segments;
	5) Computing the texture features;
	6) Configuring the neural networks for recognition.
	Model based clustering:
	Markov Random Field (MRF) based segmentation is known as model based 		segmentation. An inbuiltregion smoothness constraint is presented in MRF 		which is used for color segmentation. MRF is combined with edge detection 		for identifying the edges accurately
	
	Algorithms
	1.KNN
	2.Radial Based Function
	3.PNN
	4.BPNN
	5.SVM
	
	Conclusion
		The present paper reviews and summarizes image processing 		techniques for several plant species that
	have been used for recognizing plant diseases. The major techniques for 		detection of plant diseases are: BPNN,
	SVM, K-means clustering, and SGDM.
